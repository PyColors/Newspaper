Newspaper is a responsive web page with some data, newspapers by categories: Sport, Travel, Science, etc... with style-components...
  
### Tech

Newspaper uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Redux] - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps 
* [styled-components] - Visual primitives for the component age
* [Storybook] - Interactive JS UI component dev & test
* [Axios] - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [Enzyme] - JavaScript Testing utilities for React
* [uiGradients] - Beautiful colour gradients for design and code
* [Prettier] - Prettier is an opinionated code formatter
* [ESLint] - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX


And of course Newspaper itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
